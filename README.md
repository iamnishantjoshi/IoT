IoT project using ESP8266

As the internet is getting bigger by IoT it will be vulnerable to various attackers.

This project is about connecting an appliance to internet for automation with use of ESP8266 in a secure manner without exposing the device directly to internet. Port forwarding is not needed.

Replace the ssid and password values in the script as per your configuration.
